A Front-end project made with HTML, CSS, Javascript, and Bootstrap framework featuring my hometown, Sylhet.
Might try to include Back-end later.

By the end of the project the website is expected to contain features like:

a. Parallax Scrolling

b. Light mode and Dark mode

c. Sticky banner

d. Link to database

e. Responsiveness
